# Pinning

![public-key-pinning-lg](https://github.com/vsang181/OWASP-Interview-Preperation/assets/28651683/85fe84ea-7c64-4fd3-bab4-3e1bf5f3a078)

Pinning, also known as certificate pinning or public key pinning, is a security mechanism that helps prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by associating a host with its expected digital certificate or public key. Proper pinning implementation enhances the security of communication channels and protects against unauthorized interception or spoofing of certificates.

## Definition

Pinning involves associating a host (e.g., a website or server) with its expected digital certificate or public key, either directly in client applications or through pinned configurations deployed on servers or network devices. Pinning ensures that clients only establish connections with hosts that present the expected certificates or keys, preventing interception or spoofing attacks by malicious actors.

## Common Issues

OWASP identifies several common pinning issues, including:

- **Incomplete pinning implementation**: Failing to implement pinning across all communication channels or not enforcing pinning consistently for all hosts or domains, leaving the system vulnerable to MITM attacks.
- **Lack of backup pins or fallback mechanisms**: Not providing backup pins or fallback mechanisms in case the primary pins become unavailable or expire, causing disruptions in service availability or connectivity.
- **Failure to update pins or key pairs**: Neglecting to update pinned certificates or public keys in a timely manner, such as during certificate renewals or key rotations, resulting in invalid or outdated pins that can lead to service disruptions or connectivity issues.
- **Overly restrictive pinning policies**: Setting overly restrictive pinning policies that include a limited set of certificates or keys, increasing the risk of service disruptions or connectivity failures if the pinned certificates or keys become unavailable or compromised.
- **Insecure pinning configuration storage**: Storing pinned configurations or backup pins insecurely, such as in plaintext files or unprotected databases, exposing them to unauthorized access or disclosure.

## Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate pinning issues, developers should implement the following strategies:

- **Implement pinning across all communication channels**: Ensure that pinning is implemented consistently across all communication channels, including web browsers, mobile applications, and APIs, to protect against MITM attacks.
- **Provide backup pins or fallback mechanisms**: Include backup pins or fallback mechanisms in pinned configurations to ensure service availability and connectivity in case the primary pins become unavailable or expire.
- **Regularly update pins or key pairs**: Update pinned certificates or public keys in a timely manner, such as during certificate renewals or key rotations, to maintain valid and up-to-date pins and prevent service disruptions or connectivity issues.
- **Define flexible pinning policies**: Define flexible pinning policies that allow for the inclusion of multiple certificates or keys to accommodate changes in certificate authorities (CAs) or key rotations without causing service disruptions or connectivity failures.
- **Secure pinning configuration storage**: Store pinned configurations, backup pins, or fallback mechanisms securely, such as in encrypted files or protected databases, to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Monitor pinning status and alerts**: Monitor the status of pinning configurations and set up alerts for pinning failures or deviations from expected pins to detect and respond to potential security incidents or connectivity issues promptly.

## Scenario 1:

The application implements pinning for its mobile API endpoints but fails to enforce pinning for its web-based APIs, leaving them vulnerable to MITM attacks.

```
Mobile API Pin: "sha256/RaLd4Hzg5..."
```

## Scenario 2:

The application sets overly restrictive pinning policies that include only a single certificate authority (CA), making it vulnerable to service disruptions or connectivity failures if the pinned certificate expires or becomes unavailable.
```

Primary Pin: "sha256/AbcDeFg1..."
```

Addressing these vulnerabilities through proper pinning implementation and management helps enhance the security of communication channels and protect against unauthorized interception or spoofing of certificates.
