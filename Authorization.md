# Authorization

## Understanding Authorization:

Authorization is about verifying whether a specific request is allowed for a particular entity, which is different from authentication, where identity is verified. For instance, just because a user logged in doesn't mean they have access to everything in the system. Authorization is crucial in ensuring users can only access what they're supposed to.

## Why It Matters:

Authorization flaws are a big deal for web apps. They can lead to significant security risks, with potential consequences ranging from minor breaches to severe data compromise or service disruption.

## Recommendations:
1. **Least Privileges**: Only grant the minimum necessary access to users. Think about who needs access to what and when. It's easier to add permissions later if needed than to take them away.
2. **Deny by Default**: Always deny access unless explicitly allowed. Don't assume access is okay unless it's been specifically approved.
3. **Validate Permissions on Every Request**: Check permissions every time a request is made, regardless of where it's coming from. Use tools or frameworks that allow consistent permission checks.
4. **Thoroughly Review Tools and Technologies**: Be careful with third-party components. Even popular libraries can have vulnerabilities. Make sure you understand what you're using and implement custom logic if necessary.
5. **Prefer Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Instead of just roles, consider attributes like time of day, location, or user properties for access control. This provides more flexibility and security.
6. **Protect Lookup IDs**: Don't expose internal identifiers, and make sure users can't manipulate them to access unauthorized resources.
7. **Secure Static Resources**: Don't forget about securing static files or resources. Make sure they're included in your access control policies.
8. **Verify Authorization Checks**: Always perform access control checks on the server side. Don't rely on client-side checks, which can be easily bypassed.
9. **Handle Authorization Failures**: Plan for what happens when access is denied. Make sure your application exits safely and doesn't end up in an unstable state.
10. **Implement Logging**: Logging is crucial for detecting and investigating security incidents. Make sure you log the right amount of information securely.
11. **Test Authorization Logic**: Unit and integration tests are essential for ensuring your access control works as expected. Test different scenarios to catch potential flaws early on.

By following these guidelines, you can build a more secure and robust authorization system for your application.
