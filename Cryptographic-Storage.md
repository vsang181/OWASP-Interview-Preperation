# Cryptographic Storage

Cryptographic storage is essential for protecting sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal information, stored in databases or file systems. Proper implementation of cryptographic storage mechanisms helps mitigate the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

## Definition

Cryptographic storage involves encrypting sensitive data before storing it in databases, file systems, or other storage mediums to protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure. Cryptographic algorithms and techniques are used to encrypt data at rest, ensuring its confidentiality and integrity even if the storage medium is compromised.

## Common Issues

OWASP identifies several common cryptographic storage issues, including:

- **Weak encryption algorithms**: Using weak or outdated encryption algorithms that are vulnerable to cryptographic attacks, such as brute-force or dictionary attacks.
- **Insecure key management**: Failing to securely generate, store, and protect cryptographic keys used for encryption and decryption, making them susceptible to unauthorized access or compromise.
- **Lack of proper encryption parameters**: Using inadequate key lengths, initialization vectors (IVs), or encryption modes that do not provide sufficient security against modern cryptographic attacks.
- **Insufficient protection against insider threats**: Failing to implement proper access controls and monitoring mechanisms to prevent insider threats, such as unauthorized access by privileged users or administrators.
- **Failure to encrypt all sensitive data**: Not encrypting all sensitive data stored in the database or file system, leaving some information vulnerable to unauthorized access or disclosure.
- **Lack of regular encryption key rotation**: Using the same encryption keys for an extended period without regular rotation or updates, increasing the risk of key compromise and data exposure.

## Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate cryptographic storage issues, developers should implement the following strategies:

- **Use strong encryption algorithms**: Employ industry-standard encryption algorithms, such as AES with a secure key length, for encrypting sensitive data stored in databases or file systems.
- **Secure key management practices**: Implement secure key generation, storage, and rotation mechanisms, such as using hardware security modules (HSMs) or key management services, to protect encryption keys from unauthorized access or compromise.
- **Encrypt all sensitive data**: Ensure that all sensitive data, including passwords, credit card numbers, and personal information, is encrypted before storing it in databases or file systems to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure.
- **Implement proper access controls**: Enforce strict access controls and least privilege principles to limit access to encrypted data only to authorized users or applications and prevent insider threats.
- **Regularly audit and monitor access**: Conduct regular audits and monitoring of access to encrypted data to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activities promptly.
- **Use secure encryption parameters**: Configure encryption parameters, such as key lengths, IVs, and encryption modes, according to industry best practices and security standards to ensure sufficient protection against cryptographic attacks.
- **Encrypt data in transit and at rest**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (e.g., over the network) and at rest (e.g., stored on disk) to protect it from interception or unauthorized access during transmission or storage.
- **Provide encryption training and awareness**: Educate developers and administrators about cryptographic storage best practices, security risks, and mitigation techniques to promote secure data storage practices and prevent data breaches.

## Scenario 1:

The application stores user passwords in the database using the outdated SHA-1 hashing algorithm, which is susceptible to brute-force attacks and no longer considered secure for password storage.

```
User Password (SHA-1 Hash): 5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8
```
## Scenario 2:

The application encrypts credit card numbers using AES encryption with a weak 64-bit key length, making them vulnerable to brute-force attacks and decryption.

```
Encrypted Credit Card Number (AES, 64-bit key): a6d6e026b95f8d2c
```
Addressing these vulnerabilities through proper cryptographic storage mechanisms helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or disclosure, safeguarding the confidentiality and integrity of information stored in databases or file systems.
