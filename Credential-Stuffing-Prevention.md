# Credential Stuffing Prevention

![anatomy-credential-stuffing](https://github.com/vsang181/OWASP-Interview-Preperation/assets/28651683/c9bdc4a6-02b4-4135-93d8-5d8497e90bb3)

Credential stuffing is a type of cyber attack where attackers use large sets of stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to user accounts on various websites. By understanding common issues and implementing appropriate controls, developers can enhance the security of their applications and protect against credential stuffing attacks.

## Definition

Credential stuffing is a cyber attack method where attackers use automated scripts to repeatedly try stolen username and password combinations on different websites, exploiting the reuse of credentials across multiple platforms.

## Common Issues

Several common issues are associated with credential stuffing attacks:

- **Reuse of credentials**: Users using the same username and password combinations across multiple websites or services, making them vulnerable to credential stuffing attacks.
- **Credential breaches**: Large-scale data breaches resulting in the exposure of millions of usernames and passwords, which can be used by attackers for credential stuffing.
- **Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA)**: Websites that do not implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) are more susceptible to credential stuffing attacks since attackers only need stolen passwords to gain access.
- **Inadequate rate limiting**: Websites that do not implement rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms are more susceptible to automated credential stuffing attacks, as attackers can try multiple login attempts without restriction.
- **Insufficient monitoring and detection**: Lack of monitoring and detection mechanisms to identify and mitigate credential stuffing attacks in real-time, allowing attackers to continue their activities undetected.

## Mitigation Strategies

To address issues related to credential stuffing, developers should consider the following mitigation strategies:

- **Encourage unique passwords**: Educate users on the importance of using unique passwords for each website or service and provide tools or guidance to help them manage their passwords securely.
- **Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)**: Require users to provide multiple forms of authentication, such as passwords and one-time codes sent via SMS or authenticator apps, to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Use CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA**: Implement CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA challenges during login attempts to differentiate between legitimate users and automated bots, helping to prevent credential stuffing attacks.
- **Implement rate limiting and account lockout**: Enforce rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms to restrict the number of login attempts and prevent automated credential stuffing attacks.
- **Monitor and analyze login activity**: Implement logging and monitoring systems to track login attempts and analyze patterns for signs of credential stuffing attacks, enabling timely detection and response.
- **Alert users about suspicious login attempts**: Notify users about suspicious login attempts, such as failed login attempts from unfamiliar locations or devices, prompting them to review their account security and take appropriate action.

## Scenario 1:

A security audit identifies that the website does not enforce rate limiting on login attempts, allowing attackers to perform automated credential stuffing attacks.

```
Issue: Lack of rate limiting on login attempts
Risk: Increased susceptibility to automated credential stuffing attacks
Mitigation: Implement rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms to restrict the number of login attempts and prevent automated credential stuffing attacks.
```

## Scenario 2:

The analysis reveals that the website does not offer multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an option for users, making it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access using stolen credentials.

```
Issue: Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA)
Risk: Increased susceptibility to unauthorized access via credential stuffing attacks
Mitigation: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to require users to provide multiple forms of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
```

By addressing issues related to credential stuffing and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, developers can enhance the security of their applications and protect against potential threats and vulnerabilities.
