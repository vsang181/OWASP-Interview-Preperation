# Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

## Understanding IDOR:

IDOR occurs when attackers manipulate identifiers in a web app's URLs or parameters to access or modify objects they shouldn't have access to. This happens due to missing access control checks, which fail to verify if a user should be allowed to view or modify specific data.

## Examples:

Imagine a user accessing their profile through a URL like this: https://example.org/users/123. Here, "123" is the user's record in the database. If an attacker changes this number to, say, "124" and gains access to another user's information, it's IDOR. Similarly, in a form submission scenario, if the app doesn't properly check permissions, attackers can manipulate hidden fields like "user_id" to modify other users' profiles.

## Mitigation Strategies:

1. **Implement Access Control**: Ensure each object access is checked against user permissions. Web frameworks offer tools for this.
2. **Use Complex Identifiers**: Employing complex identifiers like GUIDs can make guessing valid values impractical for attackers. But remember, access control is vital regardless of identifier complexity.
3. **Avoid Exposing Identifiers**: If possible, don't expose identifiers in URLs or POST bodies. Instead, use session information to determine the authenticated user.
4. **Secure Object Lookup**: When fetching objects based on primary keys, make sure to limit searches to datasets users have access to. For example, in Ruby on Rails, search only within projects related to the current user.
5. **Verify Permissions**: Always check user permissions whenever an access attempt is made. This should be a structural part of your web framework's recommended approach.
6. **Defense-in-Depth Measures**: Consider replacing enumerable numeric identifiers with more complex, random ones. This could involve adding a column with random strings in the database table and using those strings in URLs. Alternatively, use UUIDs or other long random values as primary keys. Avoid encrypting identifiers as it adds complexity and may introduce security risks.

By following these strategies, you can significantly reduce the risk of IDOR vulnerabilities in your web application.
