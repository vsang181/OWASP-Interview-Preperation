# HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

![hsts-910x607](https://github.com/vsang181/OWASP-Interview-Preperation/assets/28651683/46c58b77-3afd-44b8-b223-51c66bbb595e)

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a security mechanism that helps protect web applications against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking by forcing clients to use secure HTTPS connections. Understanding and properly configuring HSTS headers are essential for enhancing the security of web applications and protecting sensitive data transmitted over the internet.

## Definition

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a security policy mechanism that instructs web browsers to only interact with a website over secure HTTPS connections, even if the user types HTTP in the address bar or follows insecure links. HSTS helps prevent protocol downgrade attacks, such as SSL Stripping, and ensures that sensitive information is transmitted securely over encrypted connections.

## Common Issues

OWASP identifies several common HSTS issues, including:

- **Incomplete HSTS implementation**: Failing to configure HSTS headers with appropriate directives, including max-age, includeSubDomains, and preload, or using invalid or inconsistent values.
- **Mixed content vulnerabilities**: Allowing mixed content (i.e., loading insecure HTTP resources within a secure HTTPS page) can bypass HSTS protections and expose users to security risks.
- **Missing HSTS preload status**: Not submitting the website to the HSTS preload list maintained by web browsers, which can lead to incomplete or ineffective HSTS enforcement.
- **Insecure HSTS policy overrides**: Allowing insecure overrides of HSTS policies, such as user-defined exceptions or insecure HSTS headers set by third-party services, can weaken HSTS protections.
- **Failure to set the "preload" directive**: Not setting the "preload" directive in HSTS headers or not submitting the website to the HSTS preload list can prevent the inclusion of the website in the browser's HSTS preload list, reducing its effectiveness against protocol downgrade attacks.

## Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate HSTS issues, developers should implement the following strategies:

- **Proper HSTS header configuration**: Configure HSTS headers with appropriate directives, including max-age (specifying the duration of HSTS enforcement), includeSubDomains (enforcing HSTS for all subdomains), and preload (submitting the website to the HSTS preload list).
- **Eliminate mixed content**: Ensure that all resources loaded by the web application, including scripts, stylesheets, and images, are served over secure HTTPS connections to prevent mixed content vulnerabilities and bypassing of HSTS protections.
- **Submit to the HSTS preload list**: Submit the website to the HSTS preload list maintained by web browsers to ensure that HSTS enforcement is applied consistently across all users and devices, even for the initial connection.
- **Enforce HSTS preloading**: Enforce HSTS preloading by setting the "preload" directive in HSTS headers and submitting the website to the HSTS preload list to prevent protocol downgrade attacks and ensure robust HSTS enforcement.
- **Implement secure HSTS policy overrides**: Implement secure mechanisms for overriding HSTS policies, such as using secure HTTP headers or server-side controls, to prevent unauthorized or insecure overrides that weaken HSTS protections.
- **Regularly review and update HSTS configurations**: Conduct regular reviews and updates of HSTS configurations to ensure that they align with security best practices and address emerging threats or vulnerabilities.
- **Educate developers and administrators**: Provide training and awareness programs for developers and administrators to understand the importance of HSTS and how to configure it properly to enhance the security of web applications.

## Scenario 1:

The application fails to set the "preload" directive in HSTS headers, preventing the inclusion of the website in the browser's HSTS preload list and reducing its effectiveness against protocol downgrade attacks.

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

## Scenario 2:

The application allows insecure HTTP resources to be loaded within a secure HTTPS page, bypassing HSTS protections and exposing users to mixed content vulnerabilities.

```

Addressing these vulnerabilities through proper HSTS configuration and management helps enhance the security of web applications and protect sensitive data transmitted over the internet.
