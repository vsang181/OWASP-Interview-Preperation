# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that tricks the victim into performing actions they don't intend to on a web application where they are authenticated. Understanding CSRF and its prevention techniques is crucial for web application security.

## Definition

CSRF is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're authenticated. The attacker tricks the user into executing malicious actions without their knowledge.

## Common Issues

OWASP lists several common CSRF vulnerabilities, including:

- **Lack of unpredictable tokens**: Tokens used to prevent CSRF attacks are predictable or not implemented at all.
- **Absence of token validation**: Failure to validate tokens, allowing attackers to forge requests.
- **Excessive trust in client data**: Not verifying the integrity of data received from the client, enabling attackers to manipulate requests.

## Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate CSRF vulnerabilities, developers should implement the following strategies:

- **Use Anti-CSRF tokens**: Generate unique tokens for each user session and include them in forms or requests. Verify these tokens on the server-side for each sensitive operation.
- **Implement SameSite attribute for Cookies**: Utilize the SameSite attribute in cookies to prevent them from being sent along with cross-origin requests, reducing the risk of CSRF attacks.
- **Use HTTP methods effectively**: Ensure that sensitive actions, such as changing user settings or performing transactions, are only allowed through safe HTTP methods like POST or PUT.
- **Implement Referer header checking**: Validate the Referer header to ensure that requests originate from the expected source, although it's not foolproof due to potential spoofing.
- **Use Double Submit Cookies**: Send a randomly generated value in both a cookie and as a request parameter. Verify that the cookie value matches the request parameter to mitigate CSRF attacks.

## Scenario 1:

The application doesn't include Anti-CSRF tokens in its forms. An attacker can craft a malicious form and trick users into submitting it, causing unintended actions on their behalf.

```
html

<form action="https://example.com/app/transferFunds" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="toAccount" value="attackerAccount" />
    <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000" />
    <!-- CSRF token missing -->
    <input type="submit" value="Click here for a free gift!" />
</form>
```

## Scenario 2:

The application fails to validate the SameSite attribute for its session cookies. Attackers can create malicious websites that, when visited by authenticated users, trigger unintended actions on the target site.

```
javascript

// Malicious website
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("POST", "https://example.com/app/changePassword", true);
xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
xhr.withCredentials = true; // Include cookies
xhr.send("newPassword=evilPassword");
```

Implementing these strategies can significantly reduce the risk of CSRF attacks and enhance the overall security posture of web applications.
