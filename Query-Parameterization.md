# Query Parameterization

Query parameterization involves using parameterized queries or prepared statements with bound parameters to protect against injection attacks in web applications. By following secure coding practices and employing defensive mechanisms, developers can mitigate the risk of injection vulnerabilities and safeguard the integrity and security of their applications.

## Definition

Query parameterization refers to the practice of using parameterized queries or prepared statements with bound parameters to construct database queries in web applications. Parameterized queries separate the query logic from the user-supplied input, preventing injection attacks by treating input data as data rather than executable code.

## Common Issues

OWASP identifies several common issues related to the lack of query parameterization in web applications, including:

- **SQL injection vulnerabilities**: Allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands by manipulating input data in dynamic SQL queries.
- **Lack of input validation**: Failing to validate input data properly before incorporating it into queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious payloads or scripts.
- **Failure to escape special characters**: Failing to escape special characters or metacharacters in user-supplied input before incorporating it into queries, leading to injection vulnerabilities.

## Mitigation Strategies

To prevent injection vulnerabilities in web applications, developers should implement the following mitigation strategies using query parameterization:

- **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements**: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements with bound parameters for database access, preventing injection attacks by separating query logic from user input.
- **Escape special characters**: Escape special characters or metacharacters in user-supplied input before incorporating it into queries, ensuring that it is treated as literal data.
- **Input validation**: Validate all input data to ensure that it conforms to expected formats, lengths, and types, and reject input that contains potentially dangerous characters or sequences.
- **Secure data access methods**: Use secure data access methods and ORM frameworks that provide built-in protection against injection attacks, such as parameterized queries, input validation, and escaping.
- **Least privilege principle**: Limit the privileges of database accounts or service accounts used by the application to reduce the impact of successful injection attacks and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
- **Regular security testing**: Conduct regular security testing, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, to identify and remediate injection vulnerabilities and other security weaknesses in web applications.
- **Security awareness training**: Educate developers, administrators, and users about injection vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and the importance of query parameterization to prevent security incidents and protect against injection attacks.

## Scenario 1:

The application uses parameterized queries with bound parameters for database access, preventing SQL injection attacks.

```
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?";
try (Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    pstmt.setString(1, userInput);
    ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
    // Process results
}
```

## Scenario 2:

The application validates user input to ensure that it only contains alphanumeric characters and rejects input that contains special characters or metacharacters.

```
String userInput = request.getParameter("username");
if (!userInput.matches("[a-zA-Z0-9]+")) {
    // Reject input
}
```

Implementing query parameterization helps prevent injection vulnerabilities in web applications and ensures the security and integrity of database queries against injection attacks.
