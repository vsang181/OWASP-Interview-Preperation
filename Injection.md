# Injection

![Injection2](https://github.com/vsang181/OWASP-Interview-Preperation/assets/28651683/bda02033-e542-4d69-a623-8cea47ad9cb5)

Injection attacks are a prevalent threat in web applications, where attackers exploit vulnerabilities to inject malicious code or commands into input fields or data streams. Understanding injection vulnerabilities and implementing secure coding practices are essential for protecting against SQL injection, command injection, and other injection attacks.

## Definition

Injection attacks involve inserting malicious code or commands into input fields, data streams, or external systems to manipulate the behavior of web applications or compromise their security. Common types of injection attacks include SQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection, and XML injection, among others.

## Common Issues

OWASP identifies several common injection issues, including:

- **SQL injection**: Allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands by manipulating input fields or parameters used in database queries, leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or data manipulation.
- **Command injection**: Allowing attackers to execute arbitrary system commands by injecting malicious input into command execution functions, leading to unauthorized system access, data exfiltration, or system compromise.
- **LDAP injection**: Allowing attackers to manipulate LDAP queries by injecting malicious input, leading to unauthorized access to directory services, data leakage, or user impersonation.
- **XML injection**: Allowing attackers to manipulate XML documents or data structures by injecting malicious input, leading to XML parsing errors, data leakage, or XML entity expansion attacks.

## Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate injection attacks, developers should implement the following strategies:

- **Use parameterized queries**: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements with bound parameters to prevent SQL injection attacks and ensure that input data is treated as data, not executable code.
- **Input validation and sanitization**: Validate and sanitize input data to ensure that it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious characters or commands that could be used in injection attacks.
- **Least privilege principle**: Limit the privileges of database accounts, system accounts, or service accounts to restrict the impact of successful injection attacks and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
- **Use ORM frameworks**: Use Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks or data access layers that automatically handle parameterization and input sanitization to mitigate the risk of injection vulnerabilities.
- **Avoid dynamic queries**: Avoid dynamically constructing SQL queries or command strings based on user input or untrusted data, as this can introduce injection vulnerabilities and increase the attack surface.
- **Secure coding practices**: Follow secure coding practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and proper error handling, to prevent injection vulnerabilities and other common security flaws in web applications.
- **Regular security testing**: Conduct regular security testing, including vulnerability scanning, code reviews, and penetration testing, to identify and remediate injection vulnerabilities and other security weaknesses in web applications.
- **Security awareness training**: Educate developers, administrators, and users about injection attacks, secure coding practices, and the importance of input validation and sanitization to prevent security incidents and protect against injection vulnerabilities.

## Scenario 1:

The application constructs SQL queries dynamically using user input without proper validation or parameterization, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

```
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + userInput + "'";
```

## Scenario 2:

The application executes system commands based on user-supplied input without proper validation or sanitization, making it vulnerable to command injection attacks.

```
command = "ping " + userInput
os.system(command)
```
Addressing these vulnerabilities through proper input validation, parameterization, and secure coding practices helps protect against injection attacks and ensures the security and integrity of web applications.
