# Choosing and Using Security Questions

Security questions are commonly used as an additional authentication factor or as part of the "Forgot Password" process. However, if not chosen and implemented carefully, security questions can introduce security vulnerabilities and risks. By understanding common issues and implementing appropriate controls, developers can enhance the security of their security questions and protect against potential threats.

## Definition

Security questions are predefined questions or prompts used to verify a user's identity during the authentication or password recovery process. Users select or provide answers to these questions when setting up their accounts.

## Common Issues

Several common issues are associated with choosing and using security questions:

- **Weak security questions**: Using security questions with answers that are easily guessable or publicly available, such as "What is your mother's maiden name?" or "What is your pet's name?"
- **Inadequate question selection**: Providing security questions with limited options or relevance, leading to predictable answers and increased susceptibility to guessing attacks.
- **Insufficient answer complexity**: Allowing users to provide simple or easily guessable answers to security questions, such as single-word responses or common phrases.
- **Lack of diversity**: Offering a limited set of security questions that may not cater to a diverse user base or account types, increasing the risk of repetitive or predictable answers.
- **Poor implementation**: Storing security question answers insecurely, transmitting them in plaintext, or using them as the sole authentication factor without additional verification.

## Mitigation Strategies

To address issues related to choosing and using security questions, developers should consider the following mitigation strategies:

- **Select strong security questions**: Choose security questions that have subjective answers, are not publicly available, and are relevant to the user's personal experiences.
- **Provide diverse options**: Offer a diverse set of security questions that cover various topics and demographics, allowing users to choose questions that are meaningful to them.
- **Enforce answer complexity**: Require users to provide complex answers to security questions, such as longer phrases or combinations of words and numbers, to reduce predictability.
- **Educate users**: Educate users on the importance of selecting strong security questions and answers, and provide guidance on how to choose and protect their security information.
- **Implement additional verification**: Use security questions as part of a multi-factor authentication (MFA) process or combine them with other authentication factors, such as email verification or SMS codes.
- **Secure storage and transmission**: Store security question answers securely using strong encryption and hashing algorithms, and ensure that they are transmitted over secure channels, such as HTTPS.

## Scenario 1:

A security audit identifies that the application offers a limited set of security questions, such as "What is your favorite color?" and "What is your hometown?"

```
Issue: Lack of diverse security question options
Risk: Increased susceptibility to guessing attacks and repetitive answers
Mitigation: Offer a diverse set of security questions covering various topics and demographics to cater to a wider range of users.
```

## Scenario 2:

The analysis reveals that the application allows users to provide single-word answers to security questions, such as "blue" or "dog."

```
Issue: Insufficient answer complexity for security questions
Risk: Increased predictability and susceptibility to guessing attacks
Mitigation: Require users to provide complex answers to security questions, such as longer phrases or combinations of words and numbers, to reduce predictability.
```

By addressing issues related to choosing and using security questions and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, developers can enhance the security of their applications and protect against potential threats and vulnerabilities.
